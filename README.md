# Story Maker
An After Effects Script that takes a folder full of videos and populates comps for IG stories and posts.

## The Backstory

Gus needed a way to generate content for IG from all the footage he has.
Sometimes it's a showcase of a new course, or little clips he takes during events or workshops.
This first approach is not a fully automated solution, since it may still need a human hand to make sure the parts of the videos that are shown are really the best, but it makes all the comps and lays out all the videos to get him started.

## How to use it
You'll need to create your base comps first.
Name them "story_N" and "square_N" (where N is a number) and add your design to the top layers. Make sure you lock the design layers once you are done!
Run the script and select a folder full of footage when prompted.
Enjoy.
